### Hi, hej, moi! 🤓 👋

I'm a full-stack dev, splitting my time between Turku, Finland (🇫🇮) ⇄ Stockholm, Sweden (🇸🇪), mainly by 🚢.

My dream tech stack is `.js`, `.vue`, `.scss`, `.html`, `.svg`, but I also do `React`, `PHP`, `C#` and `Java`, when it's required. Should probably get started with Python.

I'll give anything a shot, at least twice.

Random facts for personality: my first, super-ugly website, from '95, used the `<marquee>` tag to a disturbing extent, and I'm obsessed with 🍅 and 🍝.
