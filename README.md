# Hi, hej, moi – I'm Jenni! 🤓 👋

I'm a creative technologist, splitting my time between Turku, Finland (🇫🇮) ⇄ Stockholm, Sweden (🇸🇪), mainly by 🚢.

- 👩‍💻 JavaScript: Vue 💚, TypeScript, ES6, Vitest, Express, Node.js. Not the biggest fan, but never say never: React, jQuery, KnockoutJS
- ✨ CSS pure & with Sass, also Tailwind, responsive web animations & transitions (GSAP 🙌)
- 🚸 Semantics, accessibility, HTML5 (+ legacy templating systems like Pug/Jade)
- 🗃️ Firebase first, but I also know MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- 👵 WordPress (standard & headless) ever since its predecessor Greymatter, ActionScript 3 (🪦 RIP), OOP, PHP, very little C#, and some Java.
- 🔮 **Currently spinning**: Vite, Vue, Astro, Tailwind

## Random facts for personality
- My first, super-ugly website, from '95, used the `marquee` tag to a disturbing extent
- That same website had a lime green background and blue text. 👍 for a11y 🤦
- I'm obsessed with 🍅 and 🍝

## Random brags (mostly for developer profiling)
Since my dev journey started in '95, I've…

- Built numerous (progressive) web apps (PWAs)
- Coded fun & gamified financial systems with reporting tools 🎪
- Created e-learning applications for healthcare, middle schoolers and adults
- Left tons of bugs (probably) and easter eggs (intentionally) in random projects
- Coded twenty-something web-based games (with Pixi.js, Impact.js and vanilla, once Flash wasn't an option anymore)
- Made numerous WordPress themes, plugins and headless sites from scratch
- Taught front-end developers since 2011 in tech trainings & courses
- Realized the importance of technical writing and documentation
- Remembered multiple times how hard it is to keep up with everything web 🤿
- Experimented and done a lot of quick & dirty PoCs as well as some well-documented, well-written heavy duty systems
