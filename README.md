# Hi, hej, moi – I'm Jenni! 🤓 👋

I'm a creative technologist, splitting my time between Turku, Finland (🇫🇮) ⇄ Stockholm, Sweden (🇸🇪), mainly by 🚢.

## Tech stuff
- 👩‍💻 JavaScript: Vue, TypeScript, ES6, Express, Node.js, Vitest, React, & legacy jQuery & Knockout
- ✨ CSS with Sass, Tailwind, responsive web animations & transitions
- 🚸 Semantics, accessibility, HTML5 (+ legacy templating systems like Pug/Jade)
- 🗃️ Firebase, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- 👵 I also know WordPress (standard & headless), ActionScript 3 (🪦 RIP), OOP, PHP, C# (but my head hurts real bad afterwards), and Java
- 🔮 **Currently spinning**: Vite, Vue, Astro, Tailwind

## 🛠️ Since my dev journey started in '95, I've…
- Built numerous (progressive) web apps (PWAs)
- Coded fun (yes!) financial systems with reporting tools 🎪
- Created e-learning applications for healthcare, middle schoolers and adults
- Left tons of bugs (probably) and easter eggs (intentionally) in random projects
- Coded twenty-something web-based games (with Pixi.js, Impact.js and vanilla, once Flash wasn't an option anymore)
- Made numerous WordPress themes, plugins and headless sites from scratch
- Taught front-end developers since 2011 in tech trainings & courses
- Fallen in love with technical writing and documentation
- Remembered multiple times how hard it is to keep up with everything web 🤿

## Random stuff 🎲
I agree with Sartre, three o'clock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do.

But…

> I'll try anything, at least twice.

Random facts for personality:
- My first, super-ugly website, from '95, used the `<marquee>` tag to a disturbing extent
- That same website had a lime green background and blue text. 👍 for a11y 🤦
- I'm obsessed with 🍅 and 🍝
- I _love_ meeting new people & chatting, so [post an issue in this repo](https://github.com/postmodernistx/postmodernistx/issues/new) & let's chat if you're a daredevil!
- For the shy ones, you can find me on LinkedIn or e-mail me at teapot@jennipulli.se
