# Hi, hej, moi – I'm Jenni! 🤓 👋

I'm a creative technologist, splitting my time between Turku, Finland (🇫🇮) ⇄ Stockholm, Sweden (🇸🇪), mainly by 🚢.

- 👩‍💻 JavaScript: Vue, TypeScript, ES6, Vitest, Express, Node.js. Eww but OK if I have to: React, jQuery, KnockoutJS
- ✨ CSS with Sass, Tailwind, responsive web animations & transitions
- 🚸 Semantics, accessibility, HTML5 (+ legacy templating systems like Pug/Jade)
- 🗃️ Firebase first, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB last
- 👵 I also know WordPress (standard & headless), ActionScript 3 (🪦 RIP), OOP, PHP, very little C# (but my head hurts real bad afterwards), and Java
- 🔮 **Currently spinning**: Vite, Vue, Astro, Tailwind

## Random facts for personality
- My first, super-ugly website, from '95, used the `marquee` tag to a disturbing extent
- That same website had a lime green background and blue text. 👍 for a11y 🤦
- I'm obsessed with 🍅 and 🍝
- I <em>love</em> meeting new people & chatting, so <a href="https://github.com/postmodernistx/postmodernistx/discussions">post a discussion in this repo</a> & let's chat if you're a daredevil!
- For the shy ones, you can find me on LinkedIn or e-mail me at <a href="mailto:teapot@jennipulli.se">teapot@jennipulli.se</a>

## Random brags (mostly for developer profiling)
Since my dev journey started in '95, I've…

- Built numerous (progressive) web apps (PWAs)
- Coded fun & gamified financial systems with reporting tools 🎪
- Created e-learning applications for healthcare, middle schoolers and adults
- Left tons of bugs (probably) and easter eggs (intentionally) in random projects
- Coded twenty-something web-based games (with Pixi.js, Impact.js and vanilla, once Flash wasn't an option anymore)
- Made numerous WordPress themes, plugins and headless sites from scratch
- Taught front-end developers since 2011 in tech trainings & courses
- Realized the importance of technical writing and documentation
- Remembered multiple times how hard it is to keep up with everything web 🤿
